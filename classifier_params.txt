Parameters used to extract features and train the LinearSVC classifier:
        load_extracted_features=True,  # load features from file (faster development of classifier)
        save_extracted_features=False,  # save extracted features to file
        sample_size=None,  # max number of samples to use
        random_state=1,  # for splitting dataset into train/test sets, set to fixed number for non-random
        test_size=0.2,  # fraction of test set
        color_space='YUV',  # color space to use
        linearsvc_c=0.001,  # C parameter of LinearSVC

        add_spatial_features=True,  # True to include spatial features (resized image)
        spatial_size=(32, 32),

        add_histogram_features=True,  # True to include color histogram
        histogram_bins=32,

        add_hog_features=True,  # True to include HOG (histogram of gradients) features
        hog_orientations=9,
        hog_pixels_per_cell=8,
        hog_cells_per_block=2,
        hog_channel='ALL'
